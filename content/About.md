I studied political science a decade before joining this masters program at the University of Toronto, graduating in 2009. In the intervening decade, I've been a designer, software developer, consultant, and entrepreneur working at organizations like [IDEO](https://ideo.com), the [Defense Digital Service](https://dds.mil)/[US DIgital Service](https://usds.gov), [IKEA](https://ikea.com), not to mention my own products though [Stupid Systems](https://stupidsystems.com).
